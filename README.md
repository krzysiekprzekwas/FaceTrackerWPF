# FaceTracker

FaceTracker is my attempt to create a live face tracking application using the built-in webcam. I came up with this project as part of my home programming study related to current university topics. Mainly developed with an attitude for fun and self-education. My final goal was to realize how much work and viewers put sites like Snapchat, Instagram and Messenger into their filters.
